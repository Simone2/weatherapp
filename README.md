# Weather.app - also known as *Weather.exe*
***Ok, but what is it?***

**Weather** started as a little side project of mine. It's an app built in  [**Electron**](https://electronjs.org/), powered by  [**OpenWeatherMap**](https://openweathermap.org/).

## How to run it?
1. **First of all,** you have to supply your OpenWeatherMap api key *(you can find it [here](https://openweathermap.org/api))*.
Then, copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. You can put your key and city name in this file.- *the tutorial is [here](tutorial.md)*

 2. Then, run `npm install` in the project directory. 
2. Now, package **Weather** using `npm run package`
3. Run the *Weather.exe* or, if You are on Mac, *Weather.app*

**If You just want to preview it, just download the already built package [here](https://github.com/0-1-0-1/weatherapp/releases)!**

## What can it do?
Currently not much. **Weather** lives in system tray waiting for you to open it.
It only displays current temperature, pressure, humidity, min - max temperature and wind speed.

## Key Shortcuts
**CTRL + R** - *Refresh view*

## Known bugs
