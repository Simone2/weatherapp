4. **Now the fun stuff begins** with our OpenWeatherMap api key from the steps above we will go through and modify the files as needed. 

## Download The Repository
**The trusty ready made package is located [here](https://github.com/0-1-0-1/weatherapp/releases/tag/Stable)!**

5. We will then need to make a copy of the `.env.example` file and simply call it `.env`. In the new `.env` file, you will see the lines to add the data.

6. Now, package **Weather** using Electron Packager

  # Then open a terminal or command prompt window inside of the main src directory then run this code below
   
```sh
npm install
npm run package
```

7. Run the *Weather.exe* or, if You are on Mac, *Weather.app*
